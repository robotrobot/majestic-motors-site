        </div>


        <p class="lead">
            We are honoured to have been entrusted to restore this 1955 Morgan Plus 4 by a local family, who have owned it for
            over 45 years. The brief for the project was to perform a full restoration whilst retaining as much of the
            original car as possible whilst making some safety, reliability and usability modifications to ensure the
            car can be enjoyed for years to come by the owner and her children.
        </p>

            The owner has many memories of enjoying the car with her husband during the 1970s. In addition to usual touring,
            the car also saw service in competitive hill climbs and sprints. Indeed, the mechanical specification deviates
            from standard with some period tuning thanks to carburettor and inlet manifold modifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sadly, following an engine failure around 1978, the car was parked up in a barn at the family home, with the
            intention to enact repairs soon after. However, soon after the demands of a young family meant that the car
            was put to one side for decades, untouched.
