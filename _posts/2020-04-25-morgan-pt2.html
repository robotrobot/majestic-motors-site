            <h1><em>Part 2:</em> Chassis and ash frame restoration</h1>
            <h2>January 2020</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
            The body over ash frame and steel chassis construction of the Plus 4 was unchanged in over 70 years, from
            it's 1950 debut right through to late 2019 - ironically about the same time we started the restoration of this
            example.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our initial focus was to attend to the ash frame, which had suffered somewhat in storage. As per our
            brief to preserve and mend, rather than replace, we sympathetically let new wood into the original ash frame only
            where necessary. The structurally sound, but somewhat patinaed remainder was treated with a preservative
            coating
        </p>

            Next was the chassis, and again whilst these are available new from the factory our objective was to repair
            the original item. The car had some accident damage over 50 years ago, and the area around the steering box
            had some evidence of dubious repairs. Whilst attending to these we reinforced this critical area, as well as
            making modifications to accept modern seatbelts (which the vehicle would never have had) and adding a firewall
            between the passenger compartment and the fuel tank.
