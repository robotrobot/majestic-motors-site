        <p>
            With many of the smaller brackets and ancillary components having been shot blasted and recoated, we now
            turn our attention to a dry build of the chassis, frame and body. The objective here is to ensure perfect
            fit and finish of the panels, and make any required modifications, before the paint stage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many hours were spent in particular on the fit of the door skins to the body, this is now better than it
            would have been when the car left the factory in 1965.
        </p>
