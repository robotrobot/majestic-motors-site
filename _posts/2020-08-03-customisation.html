        <p class="lead">With our foundations in engineering, customisation and modifications are taken in our stride. If you want your project to be just that little bit different, or to stand out from the crowd. We can modify or customise your car or bike to your specification. Be it an engine swap for more punchy performance, or body work modification for that unique customised look. We can fit parts supplied or source parts for you, i.e. body kits wide wheel arches etc. We also have the ability to fabricate panels in house if you want something truly unique. Contact us today to discuss your project and find out what we can do to bring your imagination to reality.</p>
