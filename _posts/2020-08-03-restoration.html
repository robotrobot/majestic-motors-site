        <p class="lead">We can cater for full or part restoration or just a helping hand to kick start a stalled project.</p>
        <p>To complete a full restoration we would first strip the car or bike down completely to its component parts. As each part is removed it is inspected, labelled and categorized into what can be restored, repaired or is in need of replacement.</p>
        <p>The chassis or frame can be either media blasted or acid dipped depending on customer preference. Panel work will be replaced using genuine parts where available or fabricated in house and welded into place to factory specification.</p>
        <p>The bodyshell or frame is then protected against future corrosion using the latest automotive standards. Further to this all box sections etc are then injected with cavity protection.</p>
        <p>All component parts are given an equal amount of due care and attention and then refitted to the finished body shell or frame. Attention to detail is our forte!</p>
