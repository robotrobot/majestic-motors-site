        <p class="lead">Whether you need a small repair to pass the next MOT or significant structural work completing we can help. We can manufacturer replacement panels if originals are no longer available. All rusty metal work is removed and treated and new metal welded in to place, not simply patched over the top! Structural or cosmetic we have the skills to revitalise your vehicle.</p>
