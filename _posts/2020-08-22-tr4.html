            <h4>How we finished a project stalled for over four decades</h4>

        <p class="lead">The owner of this Triumph TR4 had not driven it since 1970. Taken off the road with the intention to restore, the car was finally painted over 20 years ago by another specialist. Finally, the owner turned to us to complete the restoration he started over four decades earlier!</p>

        <p class="lead">Full story coming very soon.</p>
