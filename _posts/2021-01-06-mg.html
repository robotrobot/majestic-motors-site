        <p class="lead">At Majestic Motors we have extensive experience with all models of MG including MGA, MGB, MGC, Midget and even the pre-war models such as the J-Type.</p>

        <p class="lead">We can offer simple servicing, through mechanical recomissioning or overhaul, to full body restoration and trim.</p>

        <p>Below you'll find a small sample of the project work we have completed recently.</p>

        <h3>MG B Roaster bodywork recomissioning, December 2020</h3>

        <p>This B Roaster came to us as a tidy looking car with some rust bubbling in the rear arch area. Unfortunately it had been repaired poorly in the past and required whole new
            lower wing areas letting in as well as some work to the inner arches and sill ends. We also reshaped the rear bootlid for a better fit, made repair panels for the inner quarters
            (a previous owner had cut holes for speakers) and finished the car with a complete respray.
