        <p class="lead">
            Alfa Romeo is one of our favourite marques here at Majestic Motors - especially the 105 series. Between us,
            we own three of them! It's also a popular make amongst our customers, over the last couple of years not a week
            has gone by without one being in the workshop!
        </p>

        <p class="lead">We can offer simple servicing, through mechanical recomissioning or overhaul, to full body restoration and trim.</p>

        <p class="lead">Below you'll find a small sample of the project work we have completed recently:</p>

        <ul class="mb-5">
            <li>Alfa GTV 2000 full restoration</li>
            <li>Alfa Spider 2000 reassembly</li>
            <li>Alfa 2600 Sprint</li>
            <li>Alfa GT Junior restomod with Twin Spark engine conversion</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="gtv_2000">Alfa GTV 2000 full restoration</h4>

        <p>
            This 2000 GTV is a one-owner car, we fully bare-metal restored it for the original owner over a period of three years.
        </p>

        <h4 id="spider_2000">Alfa Spider 2000 reassembly</h4>

        <p>This car arrived to us with body and paintwork finished, but disassembled in a number of boxes. It had been
            through a number of specialists in the past, who had failed to complete the project. The owner asked us to
            put the jigsaw puzzle back together. There were many missing pieces!
        </p>
        <p>
            The end result is a car that drives exceptionally well and the owner can use and enjoy.
        </p>

        <h4 id="2600_sprint">Alfa 2600 Sprint</h4>

        <p>
            We're currently recomissioning "Georgio", an exceptionally rare UK-market RHD 2600 Sprint, to his former
            glory. His immediate needs are in the cabin - his tired front seats, dash top and door cards need some attention.
        </p>

        <h4 id="gt_junior">Alfa GT Junior restomod with Twin Spark engine conversion</h4>

        <p>
            This car is one of ours, which we have been developing for road and track use over the last few years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Equipped with a fully-forged Twin Spark engine conversion on throttle bodies producing over 200bhp, mated to
            a full race clutch and Gripper LSD rear axle.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have developed a motorsport electronics package, adding both reliability and technology in the form of full
            datalogging capability with track camera system.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are further refining the package during 2021 with the addition of an AP Racing floating disc conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the race car technology the car also features a leather interior with wool carpeting and heated seats!
            The car is an example of the kind of engineering we can over to any restomod project.
