                <h5><em>Technical Director</em></h5>
                <p>
                    Ben started Majestic Motors in 2015 after a 15-year career in the automotive industry as a Design and
                    Production Engineer, working for iconic brands such as Triumph Motorcycles, Aston Martin, Marcos, TVR and Caterham.

                <p>
                    At Majestic Motors, Ben heads up the workshop side of the business, supporting technicians and overseeing quality,
                    designing and engineering custom components and builds as well as estimating jobs and diagnosing and assessing vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ben has an eclectic collection of classic cars, most - truth be told - in need of full restoration. His favourite
                    marque is Mercedes Benz - between them he and his partner own a pair of Mercedes SLs, one classic one modern!

                <p>
                    Chris had a successful career building and developing software companies before launching Majestic Motorsport with
                    Ben in 2017. Following a successful couple of years managing the race team, Chris became a partner in the restoration
                    and storage businesses in early 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chris leads on sales, marketing, business development and customer services across all three businesses.

                <p>
                    Being a child of the 1980s, Chris' favourite marque is Porsche, although he also has a soft spot for Alfa Romeo
                    and has been slowly "improving" his 1972 Alfa Romeo GT Junior for about 15 years.

                <p>
                    Paul joined Majestic Motors in 2018 following a long career in bodywork and accident repair. He is a master fabricator and is generally
                    involved in metalwork repair usually required in the earlier stages of restoration.

                <p>
                    Paul also restores his own vehicles in his spare time - he is currently completing his VW Bay window camper - but his favourite marque
                    is Alfa Romeo, owning both a Brera (daily driver) and a 105-series GTV.
